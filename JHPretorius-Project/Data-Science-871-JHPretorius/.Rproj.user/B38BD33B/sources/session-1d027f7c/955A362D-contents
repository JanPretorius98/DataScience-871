#       Introduction \label{Introduction}

Education and health are intertwined aspects that significantly influence a child's life trajectory, particularly within the socioeconomic context of South Africa. This report aims to determine the causality between child health and associated socioeconomic factors on school attendance within South Africa. I utilise the National Income Dynamics Study wave 5 data on children and employ a two-stage probit regression model with an instrumental variable approach to explore this relationship. The first stage predicts child health status based on various factors, and these predicted probabilities are used as instrumental variables in the second stage to forecast successful school attendance. The research has unveiled several crucial insights about the interplay of child health and various socioeconomic factors on school attendance within the South African context. Primarily, it has been established that the health of a child, intertwined with particular socioeconomic variables, considerably impacts school attendance. Therefore, policymaking should target these domains. The disparity across the robustness checks, however, implies that the relationship between child health, socioeconomic variables, and school attendance is intricate and multifaceted, requiring more tailored solutions to effectively tackle school attendance and success.

#       Data and Methodology \label{Data}

This study uses data from the National Income Dynamics Study [@SALDRU2018], focusing on South African children's demographic and socioeconomic attributes. New variables were created to encapsulate child health and school attendance, such as 'Health', 'Total expenditure on schooling', and 'Attendance' (Successful^['Successful' implies that the child passed a grade two years in a row.] school attendance last two years), among others. The variables are shown and explained in Table \ref{tab1}. I use a two-stage probit regression model, with an instrumental variable approach to control for potential endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity, inspired by @Lin2017's approach. The first stage predicts a child's health status using key health-related indicators, including 'Recent illnesses', 'Medical aid coverage', and 'Professional consultations'. The predicted probabilities from the first stage are used in the second stage to predict 'Successful school attendance over the last two years', incorporating predictors like 'Schooling expenses', 'Pre-primary attendance', 'Parental education', and 'Social grants'. Equations \ref{eqmod1} and \ref{eqmod2} in the appendix show the mathematical expressions for the models employed.

#       Results     \label{Results}

The visualization presented in Figure \ref{Figure1} underscores the correlation between children's health status and their successful attendance at school. It clearly portrays the disproportionality of successful school attendance among healthy and unhealthy children, with a larger portion of unhealthy children being unsuccessful in school attendance. This emphasizes the potential impact of health status on educational outcomes among children.

In the first stage probit regression model (results shown below in Table \ref{tabreg1}), all variables yielded significant results. Having an illness or disability, being recently ill, or consulting a medical professional each lead to a significant decrease in the probit score of a child being healthy. Specifically, the presence of an illness or disability decreases the probit score by 0.4595, being recently ill by 0.27477, and consulting a medical professional by 0.25738. Conversely, having medical aid significantly increases the probit score of a child being healthy by 0.27963. This suggests the importance of medical aid in promoting child health, while also emphasizing the negative health impact of illness and the need for professional medical consultation.

The second stage probit regression model (Table \ref{tabreg1}) reveals important insights. Predicted health status significantly influences school attendance, with healthier children having a higher probability of successful attendance, as demonstrated by a coefficient of 0.9848 (p < 0.001). Increased school expenditure slightly improves attendance probability (coefficient: 0.00000886, p = 0.016), as does pre-primary education attendance (coefficient: 0.11059, p = 0.007517). Conversely, children receiving social grants are less likely to attend school successfully (coefficient: -0.1871, p < 0.001). While 'No fees school' and 'Parents Have Matric' were not statistically significant at the 0.05 level, they still might exert an influence, with 'Parents Have Matric' showing marginal significance (p = 0.081286).

#       Robustness Checks 

The robustness of the second stage probit regression model were examined and presented in Table \ref{tabrobust}. Firstly, I calculated Cook's distance to identify influential observations. Observations with a Cook's distance greater than 4/n (where n is the sample size) were considered influential and were removed from the data. A new model was then fitted using the data without these influential observations. The variables 'Health (Predicted)', 'Total expenditure on schooling', and 'Parents Have Matric' remained significant, underlining their importance in school attendance. However, 'No fees school', 'Attendance of pre-primary', and 'Social grant' became statistically insignificant. Also, 'Intercept' and 'Social grant' had large yet imprecise coefficients, indicating model sensitivity to influential observations. This suggests some instability in the model, warranting further research.
```{r}

# Calculate Cook's distance
df$cooks_dist <- cooks.distance(`Second Stage Model`)

# Filter out high Cook's distance observations
df_no_infl <- df %>%
  filter(cooks_dist < 4/nrow(df))

# Re-run model
glm_no_infl <- glm(formula = second_stage_formula, family = binomial(link = "probit"), data = df_no_infl)

```

In the second robustness check, the model included 'Health (Predicted)', 'No. of nights spent under roof (week)', and interaction between 'Walks to school' and 'Time taken to reach school' as predictors of 'Attendance'. Among these variables, only 'Health (Predicted)' was statistically significant and positively associated with school attendance, suggesting that healthier students have higher school attendance. In the third robustness check, the model was applied to female students specifically, with 'Health (Predicted)', 'Population group', and 'Province' as predictors. Here, 'Health (Predicted)' emerged as the only statistically significant factor, indicating a strong positive association with school attendance. This further emphasizes the importance of health on school attendance, specifically for female students. In both models, other predictors were not statistically significant. Nonetheless, these robustness checks support the primary analysis in highlighting the importance of health as a determinant of school attendance.

```{r}
# Second stage regression
new_formula_1 <- `Attendance` ~  `Health (Predicted)` + 
                        `No. of nights spent under roof (week)` +
                        `Walks to school`*`Time taken to reach school`

new_formula_2 <- `Attendance` ~  `Health (Predicted)` + 
                        `Population group` + `Province`
# For example, consider males and females separately
glm_1 <- glm(formula = new_formula_1, family = binomial(link = "probit"), data = df)
glm_2 <- glm(formula = new_formula_2, family = binomial(link = "probit"), data = df %>% filter(Gender == "1"))
```

```{r modeltable2, results='asis'}

# Discussion & Conclusion

This report presents several important findings regarding the influence of child health and socioeconomic factors on schooling success in South Africa. Foremost among these findings is the significant positive influence of a child's health on their school attendance. This underscores the importance of good health in enabling regular school attendance. Certain socioeconomic factors also play a critical role. For instance, the total expenditure on schooling and whether parents have matric qualifications were found to positively correlate with school attendance. On the contrary, the receipt of a social grant did not demonstrate a significant impact, challenging assumptions about the role of these grants in improving school attendance. This may be due to the fact that individuals that are dependent on these grants do have more challenging social issues that contribute to the dearth of success at school.

However, the report's findings should be interpreted in light of the significant variations observed in the robustness checks. Notably, upon excluding potential outliers in one of the checks, the predictive power of health on school attendance was found to be smaller than in the main model. This suggests the presence of outliers could be influencing this relationship in the initial model. In two other robustness checks models, where different predictor variables were included such as the number of nights spent under a roof each week, the time taken to reach school, and province demographics, the health coefficients were larger. This insinuates these variables could amplify the effect of health on school attendance.

These findings highlight that child health, coupled with specific socioeconomic factors, significantly influence school attendance. Hence, policy interventions should prioritise these areas. Moreover, the disparities in the robustness checks underscore that the interaction between child health and other variables is complex and could influence school attendance in different ways. Thus, more nuanced approaches might be needed to address school absenteeism and failure effectively.
